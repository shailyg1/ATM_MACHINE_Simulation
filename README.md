An ATM (Automated Teller Machine) is a machine that allows bank customers to perform financial transactions, such as cash withdrawals, deposits, balance inquiries, and PIN changes, without needing a human teller. This simulation aims to mimic these functionalities through a console-based application in Java.

Core Concepts and Components
Account Balance Inquiry:
This functionality allows users to check their current account balance. It involves accessing and displaying the balance stored in the system.
Cash Withdrawal:
This function enables users to withdraw cash from their account. It requires checking the available balance to ensure sufficient funds are present before deducting the requested amount.
Cash Deposit:
This feature allows users to deposit cash into their account. It involves adding the deposited amount to the current balance.
PIN Change:
Users can change their Personal Identification Number (PIN) to enhance security. This function involves verifying the current PIN and updating it with a new one provided by the user.
Transaction History:
This functionality records and displays a history of all transactions performed by the user, such as deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, and PIN changes.
